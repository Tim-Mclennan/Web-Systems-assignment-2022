<p> <b>Hello, how are you? Welcome to my website!</b></p>
<br>
<p>My name is Tim and I am currently a student that attends the University of Technology Sydney (UTS). Furthermore, I am currently enrolled in the subject Web Systems. In this subject is where I am learning how to design websites with HTML and CSS.</p>
</br>

<br><p>In terms of my interests, one hobby I picked up during the covid quarantine was cooking. I seriously love to eat. I also enjoy cooking for other people. Below is a picture of one of my favourite cuisines, <span style="color:darkorange"> the cheese toastie:</br>

<p>My favourite ingredients to use in a cheese toastie include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sourdough Bread</li>
  <li>Salted Butter</li>
  <li>Gruyere Cheese</li>
  <li>Tasty Cheese</li>
  <li>Mayo</li>
  <li>Chunks of salt (Optional)</li>
</ul>
