<h2>Short, personal reflection on my website</h2>
<p>Simplicity is at the forefront of my website's overall design. I have therefore found it relatively straightforward to construct and have included all the basic components expected of this assignment.</p>
<br>
<h2>Technical Aspects</h2>
<p>In terms of the technical aspects of this website, it contains four HTML documents and one CSS document. </p>
<p>The table below provides an outline of these documents and their respective web pages:</p>
 <table>
  <tr>
  <th>Document</th>
  <th>Page Heading</th>
  <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td>index.html</td>
	<td>Home Page</td>
  <td>The home page of my website. I have given a brief written introduction of me and a cheese toastie image, as well as an unordered list.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td>past.html</td>
	<td>Past</td>
	<td>On this page is where I briefly went over my history in using web designing services. It included a table of examples.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
	<td>future.html</td>
	<td>Future</td>
	<td>On this page, I carried a small description of my ambitions.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>comments.html</td>
  <td>Comments</td>
  <td>This is the page you are on now. I have included technical details of my website in the form of descriptions, a table and some screenshots.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>websystems.css</td>
    <td>N/A</td>
    <td>This css document is concerned with solely making the entire website look good. Although it isn't necessary when creating a website, a css document will make the difference between a good website and a bad website. It contains all the elements and classes used to shape, colour and tweak the aesthetics of my website. I have provided a list of such classes below.</td>

<h2>CSS selectors I used</h2>
<p>The first challenge I was presented with when creating this website was designing the overall design of which all HTML documents would be based on. This design contains many elements and classes to portray the visual appeal of my website. In order for me to use classes, I had to refer to a CSS document (websystems.css) within the "head" element of this file.</p>
<p>Although it is essential to use HTML files to form the structure of any website, referring to this CSS document enabled me to implement many aesthetic elements, such as using different colours and sizes. </p>
<h4><b>The classes I used to style the main structure of my website include:</b></h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>'*'</b>: This class enabled me to select and edit EVERYTHING in my entire website. However, I only used it to format the font to Verdana using the 'font-family' class:</li>
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/gv2TTzn/image.png" alt="image" border="1">
<br>
<br>
    <li><b>".title"</b>: This class refers to the styling of the giant title at the very top of the website 'Assignment - Web systems website'. Its properties included changing its font size to 50 pixels and aligning it into the center:</li>
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/zRw3FNZ/Capture.png" alt="title" border="1">
<br>
<br>
    <li><b>".anchors":</b> This class is concerned with the large, orange menu bar that hosts the navigation of my four web pages. In order to use this class, I had to use the 'a' tag so I could link the menu buttons to their respective web pages. This class hosts a myriad of elements to define its features: </li>
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/H2N45Sf/image.png" alt="image" border="1">
<br>
<br>
    <li><b>".header":</b> This class is in control of styling the header of the webpage (To indicate which web page you're actually on). To keep it simple, the only property I gave it was to shift it to the left hand side:</li>
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/2tXSw2H/image.png" alt="image" border="1">
<br>
<br>
    <li><b>".body":</b> I used this element to give a 25 by 50 pixel padding to make it easier on the eyes and bring the center of attention to the text of the body. I also gave it a light colour to segment it from the rest of the page; this is called the "figure-ground" princple. I also implemented a border to help it pop:</li>
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/1r1wJvP/image.png" alt="image" border="1">
<br>
<br>
    <li><b>"p, h2, ul":</b> This class was used to shift all paragraphs, subheadings and unordered lists on my website inwards by 20 pixels. This was done so the words weren't placed right against the border:</li>
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/1nXGMZB/image.png" alt="image" border="1">
</ul>
<br>
<h4><b>Other classes I used, which weren't part of the main structure of my website, included:</b></h4>
<ul>
    <li><b>"#cheese":</b> This class was written in regards to the image of the cheese toastie on the home page. Because the class was used only for a single image and not a broad set of elements, I used the '#' instead of the 'div' selector:</li>
    <img src="https://i.ibb.co/sFxQRTc/image.png" alt="image" border="1">
<br>
<br>
  <li><b>"table, th, td":</b> This is the class I used to style the two tables on my website, the first being on my 'Past' page and the second being on my 'Comments' page. This was also a class that hosted many more elements than my other classes. 
  <br>
  <br>
  For example, I used a solid black border while setting the 'padding' to 15 pixels so there is some room between the content and the border itself. I also set the 'border-collapse' value to collapse so that the content shares walls instead of taking up unnecessary space. Additionally, I gave enough margin to separate from the background and gave the headings and data their own background colour. This was the final property list:</li>

</ul>
<br>
<h2>Aesthetics</h2>
<p>As stated previously, I have decided to use a very simplistic approach for my overall aesthetics. I wanted to prioritise a 'minimalistic' creation that made it easy to navigate and was easy on the eyes. I have created a list below so summarise the aesthetics of my website:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Probably the most prominent feature of my entire website is the large <b>title</b> spanning across the middle of all my pages. I designed the font and format of this title in a way that it will grab the reader's initial attention when they load the website. They literally cannot miss it. </li>
  <br>
  <li>In terms of the <b>colour palette</b>, I have followed my minimalistic approach by opting to use only TWO colours consistently throughout my entire website; Orange and pale orange. However, using only two colours is never enough. In order for the elements on each page to look distinguished from eachother, I spaced them separately from eachother to allow the white background to peak through. This shows the clear segregation between the title, menu, heading and body of my website. As that famous saying goes, "Less is more".</li>
  <br>
  <li>When it comes to the <b>font</b>, after much deliberating (and trial and error) I decided to use verdana. Verdana is known as a 'sans-serif' type of font which are characterised by their modern and minimalistic look, reinforcing my vision to keep things simple. I set the font to be implemented throughout my entire website by using the '*' class in the css document.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Another part of the website I wanted to make sure kept a simple approach was the <b>main div body</b> on each page. By keeping the page background white and making the foreground of the text pale orange, I was able to design a more tapered style that helped strongly differentiate the foreground against the background.</li>
  <br>
</ul>
<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>Although not mentioned often, accessibility of the internet is truly one of the hallmarks that makes it great. Websites can remove physical barriers that may otherwise prevent people, especially with disabilities, from undertaking certain tasks or interactions.</p>
<p>However, on the contrary - if a website is badly designed with little to no accessibility, it can end up excluding those very same people from the web. Therefore I have compiled a list of all the accessibility measures I have implemented into my website below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first aspect of accessibility is providing alternative text to all my images. This was done by using the 'alt' attribute inside the 'img' attribute. Providing an <b>'alt' tag</b> ensures that a user will be able to understand what the image is. For example, this is vital in the case of a slow connection, when images are switched off or when screen readers need to be used for visually impaired users.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Another way I have implemented accessibility into my website is by including the <b>'lang' (For language) attribute</b> inside an 'html' tag for all of my web pages. This means that search engines and web browsers will have an easier time trying to locate and display my webpage.</li>
  <br>
  <li>The use of <b>headings</b> is also prolific throughout my website, especially in the content itself. This is important as it allows search engines to index the structure and content of my website. Another reason I have used headings is that users will always skim pages and find exactly what they need by looking at the headings. I have made simplicity of navigation one of my priorities. Additionally, headings have been made bold to differentiate content segments on my website.</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Semantics</b> is also one of the accessibility aspects of my website that I wanted to prioritise. Having HTML documents that are semantic means using the correct tags and elements to their respective purposes. For example, using the 'div' tag instead of the 'link' tag. Semantic HTML gives context to screen readers, which read the contents of a page out loud.</li>
  <br>
  <li>In regards to <b>font</b>, I have selected Verdana as it is easier to read for someone that may have reading difficulties. Verdana is a 'Sans-Serif' font, all of which are known to be simple and easy to read compared to 'Serif' fonts such as Times New Roman. Furthermore, I have also highlighted certain parts of content to be <b>bold</b> to emphasise their importance in a text. This makes my website easier to navigate when looking for a specific part. I have highlighted certain words throughout the website by using the 'b' tag.</li>
  <br>
  <li>I have also implemented a high <b>colour contrast</b> between the background and the actual content of my website. This helps to make the page much easier to read and cause less eye strain on the user. </li>
  <br>
  <li>Another important element of my website that promotes accessibility is the <b>'Go To Top'</b> anchor at the end of each webpage. This allows users that scroll all the way to the end of the page to go back up in one click, instead of having to scroll back up. </li>
</ul>
</div>

<a href ="#top"> Go To Top</a>
</body>
